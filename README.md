# DeepWeibull
M4R project at Imperial College London about deep learning in survival analysis, supervised by Prof. Axel Gandy.

# Files
deepweibull.py - functions to train and test the Deep Weibull model
simple_models.py - functions to implement the simple regression models
synthetic_datasets.py - functions to simulate synthetic data

# Full workflow

1. Make linear Weibull dataset by running linear_weibull.py
2. Make non-linear Weibull dataset by running non_linear_weibull.py
3. Fit the models using fit_models.py
4. Analyse performance of the models using compare_performance.py
